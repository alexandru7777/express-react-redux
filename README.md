#Application in Progress

##Options Available at this moment are:
Login / SignUp (Auth Page) ;

A Database made in MongoDb, that stores "memories", which would have a title, message, tag and jpeg/png attachment;

Redux useDispatch function incorporated for later scalability;

A base structure for both front-end and back-end with packages configured;

Material UI based project.


##The final application will be able to register users, add them in database, provide user with read/write permissions for POSTS,
limited "like" actions per user, option to edit the post, pagination so that the posts will have their own page and full description and a 
search bar.
